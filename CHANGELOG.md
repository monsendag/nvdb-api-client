## 1.13.1
* Close Jersey Responses to avoid resource leak

## 1.13.0
* Renamed fields and getters in RoadNetRouteRequest:
  * `distanceThreshold` -> `distance` / `getDistance`
  * `circumferenceAroundPoints` -> `envelope` / `getEnvelope`
* Boolean field `connectionLinks` in RoadNetRouteRequest is now true by default.
* Added `length` / `getLength` and `status` / `getStatus` to `RouteOnRoadNet`.
* Send typeOfRoad properly if using `RoadNetRouteClient.postRouteOnRoadnet`.

## 1.12.1
* Added getter for apiValue on `Direction` enum

## 1.12.0
* `RoadNetClient` and `SegmentedRoadNetClient` used integer for linksequenceid, changed to long.

## 1.11.2
* Handle html response like «504 server did not respond in time».

## 1.11.1

## 1.11.0
* All `ClientFactory.create_*_Client` has been renamed to `get_*_Client`. These methods used to return a new instance each
time, now a previously created instance is returned if one exists. 
* Calling `close()` on a client returned from `ClientFactory.create_*_Client` removes it from the ClientFactory.
* `roadobject.segments` has a field `retning` with possible values `MED`/`MOT`. This is the same value as the `retning`
on the roadnet placement for the segment.

* Fix that closing a client cause all other clients to fail with message about closed connection pool.
* Existing clients use updated login information. 
* Contract and Route now has `.municipalities` and `.counties`

## 1.10.1
* ListAttribute.getAttributeType() returned STRUCT

  When NVDB API LES V3 has a different version of Datakatalogen than the version in this header 
  `HTTP 422: Nåværende datakatalogversjon i APIet er: {new version}` is returned.
* It is possible to define a callback for `RoadObjectClient` that is called when Datakatalog version changes.
  ```java
    clientFactory.createRoadObjectClient(
      DatakatalogPolicy.builder()
      .onDatakatalogUpdateCallback(() -> { /* do something */})
